# Braintrain FrontEnd

This application was built as my project submission for my final year in college. This is the frontend of the braintrain application. The application is an online forum for teachers and students to connect via an online portal. Students are able to join a batch or request for a batch. Teachers are able to create a classroom populate it with batches and further populate the batches with lectures and their timings. When the lecture is live, both the teachers and students will enter a session with a video and chat facilities.
